# Keyboard shortcuts

[Documentation](README.md) · [Using rummage](usage.md) · [Configuration](configuration.md)

These are defaults. **F1** (or `?`) shows the active bindings, including custom
ones. Editors, dialogs, Quick Look and file pickers have their own input context;
a shortcut's meaning follows the focused control.

## Views, navigation and search

## Panes

| Keys | Action | Configurable ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F3 | Toggle two panes / active pane full-width | `toggle_split` |
| Tab | Switch active pane while browsing | `switch_pane` |
| Ctrl+F5 | Copy selection to the other pane | `copy_other_pane` |
| Ctrl+F6 | Move selection to the other pane | `move_other_pane` |
| No default | Swap pane positions | `swap_panes` |
| No default | Change side-by-side / top-bottom orientation | `orient_panes` |
| No default | Open selected folder in the other pane | `open_other_pane` |
| No default | Show current folder in the other pane | `same_other_pane` |

Tab retains its normal focus behavior in text fields and dialogs. The picker stays
single-pane. Cross-pane transfers require both panes to be visible. Tabs and file
commands below operate in the active pane.

## Tabs and selection

| Keys | Action | Configurable ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ctrl+T | New tab | `new_tab` |
| Ctrl+W | Close current tab, except the last | `close_tab` |
| Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab | Next / previous tab | `next_tab`, `previous_tab` |
| Alt+1…9 | Select numbered tab | Fixed |
| Ctrl+A | Select all in the current scope | `select_all` |
| Ctrl+Space | Toggle selected item | `toggle_selection` |
| Shift+movement | Extend selection | Fixed |
| Ctrl+movement | Move without selecting | Fixed |
| Escape | Back to one entry/cancel current interaction | Fixed |

Expanded details-tree selections stay within a single parent folder. Mouse
selection gestures are covered in [Using rummage](usage.md#navigate-and-select).

## Files

| Keys | Action | Configurable ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alt+Enter | Properties / folder icon selection | `properties` |
| F2 | Rename | `rename` |
| Ctrl+Shift+N | New folder | `new_folder` |

| Shift+Delete | Delete permanently with confirmation | `erase` |
| Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z | Undo / redo | `undo`, `redo` |
| F4 | Open terminal in folder | `open_terminal` |

Copy Location, Extract Here and Extract To have no default shortcuts. Bind their
IDs `copy_location`, `extract_here`, `extract_to` or `action:<id>` explicitly.

## Context-specific keys

## Override bindings

Add to one `[keybindings]` table in `config.toml`:

```toml
[keybindings]
rename = "Ctrl+r"
select_all = "Ctrl+g"
toggle_selection = "Ctrl+j"
erase = ""
copy_location = "Ctrl+Shift+c"
```

Each entry replaces all default chords for that action. An empty string disables
it, and an omitted entry retains defaults. Use modifiers `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`,
`Super` and XKB key names; key names are case-insensitive, modifier spellings are
as shown. Use `Ctrl+plus`, not `Ctrl++`, for a literal plus key.

Custom actions use quoted keys such as `"action:compress" = "Ctrl+Alt+z"`; first
define the action using the [actions guide](actions.md). Fixed navigation,
range-selection, numbered-tab, quit and editor/dialog keys cannot be reassigned
through this table. Choose chords that do not collide with them.

Unknown IDs, invalid chords and conflicting bindings reject the binding set.
Actions, menus and bindings reload together; the prior valid set survives an
invalid reload. Run `rummage --check-config` and check F1 after editing.

## Jump to a folder

Use a quoted `go:<path>` key in the existing `[keybindings]` table:

```toml
[keybindings]
"go:~/Downloads" = "Ctrl+Alt+d"
"go:/srv/projects" = "Ctrl+Alt+p"
```

The shortcut opens the folder in the active pane’s current tab and preserves back/forward
history. It works from the views, sidebar and Quick Look; editors and dialogs keep
their input. Missing destinations show a message and leave the current folder in
place. Absolute paths, `~` and `~/` paths are supported, without shell or variable
expansion. Bindings reload live and appear in F1; the usual chord-conflict checks
and empty-string disabling apply.
